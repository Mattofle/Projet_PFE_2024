# introduction
This project represents the highlight of my three years of studies in computer science. It synthesizes the big majority of the skills, concepts, and technologies I have acquired throughout this period. We were a group of 7 students, and we had 10 days to complete this project in its entirety.

# Objective and Context
This project was carried out for an external client of the school, and our task was to digitize one of their processes. One of the main challenges was integrating a technology that we had not studied during our curriculum into the project's technology stack. After deliberation, we chose to use Angular for the frontend. This choice required significant investment in self-learning and problem-solving, as Angular was completely new to us.

## Stack
- Frontend: Angular
- Backend: Spring (Java)
- Database: MariaDB


# Good to know
During the process, we managed to have some difficulties with Lombok and due to the short amount of time we had we had to stick with it, that's why you can see some manual getters/setters in the back.
Also, this is not the base repo since the original one was in private in one of my friend's profile, I just wanted to centralize my project and have them accessible.
